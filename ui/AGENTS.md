The `ui` directory contains a Vite + React front-end used to interact with the blockchain node.

Important files:
- `index.html` – HTML page served during development and build
- `src` – TypeScript source with React components and tests
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` – Node build configuration

Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to launch the development server.
