`src` holds the TypeScript source for the web UI.

Subdirectories:
- `api` – helper functions for REST and WebSocket calls
- `components` – React UI components such as mining and wallet views
- `pages` – top level routes (currently only `Dashboard`)
- `types` – shared TypeScript interfaces
- `__tests__` – Jest/Testing Library unit tests

Entry file `main.tsx` boots the React application.
