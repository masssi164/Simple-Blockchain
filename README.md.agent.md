This README describes how to build and run the demo blockchain node. It documents REST endpoints, the WebSocket protocol (including the `HANDSHAKE` exchange) and tips for running a private network. The node automatically merges chains based on the last common block.
Updated to include a repository overview with Docker, helper scripts and layout details.
